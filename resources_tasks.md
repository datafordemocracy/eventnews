## Where we are
  * Stories are posted (stories.csv), with character encoding corrected, up/down votes, top comments, total comments added

### Research Questions
1. On what features do stories posted by right and by left differ, on what features are they similar?
2. What features of stories promote audience engagement (e.g., more comments)?
3. What features of stories promote audience perception of quality (e.g., upvotes)?
4. Are the features that promtoe engagement or quality the same for stories promoted by the right and the left?
5. Are the features from 3,4,5 those that distinguish stories posted by the left and right or those they have in common?
6. What else?

## To do next
  * Gautam" update getPosts.py to add total comments, additional corrections
  * Begin exploring various features (draft, post code; brief group on results):
    * LIWC: Alicia
    * Moral foundations: Jessica
    * Distincitive words (tf-idf): Peter
    * Topics (via topic modeling): 
    * Named entities?
  * Look into publishing outlets: everyone

## Dimensions of Cases to Compare
Vary one dimension, and try to hold others approximately constant

* Policy dimension raised (e.g., immigration, civil rights, health, women's rights, terrorism, shooting/safety?)
* Pre-post Trump era
* Nature of event as collective action/protest vs. individual action/stimulus
* Ideological orientation of originating action/stimulus 

E.g., collective action events by Trump era; policy dimensions within Trump era.

### Potential cases

* Cville events
* Mass shootings: Texas (11/17), Las Vegas (10/17), Orlanda (6/16), San Bernandino (12/15) [(more here)](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/mass-killings/index.html#frequency)
* Episodes of foreign travel by Trump
