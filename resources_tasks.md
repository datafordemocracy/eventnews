 ## Dimensions of Cases to Compare

Vary one dimension, and try to hold others approximately constant

* Policy dimension raised (e.g., immigration, civil rights, health, women's rights, terrorism, shooting/safety?)
* Pre-post Trump era
* Nature of event as collective action/protest vs. individual action/stimulus
* Ideological orientation of originating action/stimulus 

E.g., collective action events by Trump era; policy dimensions within Trump era.

### Potential cases

* Cville events
* Mass shootings: Texas (11/17), Las Vegas (10/17), Orlanda (6/16), San Bernandino (12/15) [(more here)](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/mass-killings/index.html#frequency)
