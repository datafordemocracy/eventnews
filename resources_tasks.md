 ## Steps

 * Query and scrape shared article urls from reddit: which threads? what attributes are saved?
 * Scrape articles from urls: ???
 * Background on reddit: what do we know about this population? (maybe facebook)
 * Query and download stories from establishment media
 * Create corpora from these, choose environment (python, R, ?)
 * Feature extraction: should already have reddit source, news source; extract complexity, moral foundations, sentiment, topics or policy?, named entities?, ?
 
## Dimensions of Cases to Compare

Vary one dimension, and try to hold others approximately constant

* Policy dimension raised (e.g., immigration, civil rights, health, women's rights, terrorism, shooting/safety?)
* Pre-post Trump era
* Nature of event as collective action/protest vs. individual action/stimulus
* Ideological orientation of originating action/stimulus 

E.g., collective action events by Trump era; policy dimensions within Trump era.

Do we want the Unite the Right/Cville counter rallies as anchoring case?

## Potential Media Sharing Platforms

* Reddit
* Facebook (differentiate ideological source)
* Twitter (probably not much news)

At what point do these become mainstream media sharing environments? This constrains how far back we can go temporarlly.
